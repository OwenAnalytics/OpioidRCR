/* TODO
**Review updates and checks requested on flat file**
1 -- DO NOT STRATIFY BY FACILITY LOCATION AND STATE IN THE SAME TABLE. ONLY INCLUDE FACILITY LOCATION IN ALL X ALL AND USE STATE IN ALL OTHERS. 
2 -- REPLACE "Facility_location x Eventyear x State" WITH A "YEAR ONLY" TABLE WITH NO OTHER STRATA (TO HELP DEBUG)
3 -- USING THE ENROLLMENT ROUTINE IN THE FLAT FILE, ADD AN INDICATOR FOR "ENROLLED" AND USE THAT TO GENERATE THE N WHERE CURRENTLY USING COUNT(*)
4 -- ADD A RT_&var THAT IS COUNT/COUNT-NON-MISSING SO THAT THIS DOES NOT NEED TO BE CREATED POST-HOC
